# ACRoBaT

A device for training rats to perform a modified center-out task.

Designed by David Bjånes (dbjanes@caltech.edu)

This device features two custom-printed PCBs, a 3D-printed housing unit, an Arduino microchip, and other commercially available parts that can be mounted outside a behavioral arena. It also provides a fully automated algorithm to train rats based on behavioral feedback fed into the device through various sensors.
